# Will's Bag 'o Sec Tools for the OSCP

Some of this will be scripts, some of this will be references. All of it will be useful.

I plan on collecting everything here while I study for the OSCP exam.

Keeping things organized will be key!

Update:
Passed the OSCP on October 9. I'll throw some more things in here as I comb back through my notes and what not.
